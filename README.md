# splitmix

Pure Haskell implementation of SplitMix pseudo-random number generator.

## dieharder

> [Dieharder](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php) is a random
number generator (rng) testing suite. It is intended to test generators, not
files of possibly random numbers as the latter is a fallacious view of what it
means to be random. Is the number 7 random? If it is generated by a random
process, it might be. If it is made up to serve the purpose of some argument
(like this one) it is not. Perfect random number generators produce "unlikely"
sequences of random numbers &ndash; at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng
is therefore quite subtle.

```
time dieharder-input splitmix | dieharder -a -g 200
```

The test-suite takes around half-an-hour to complete.
All tests are PASSED (occasionally WEAK).

In comparison built-in [Marsenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister)
 test takes ???.

```
time dieharder-input -a
```

Note: the performance can be potentially further improved when GHC gets
[SIMD Support](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/SIMD/Implementation/Status).
